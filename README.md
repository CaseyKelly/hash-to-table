# Rails ActiveRecord Practice

Create some ActiveRecord models:

- In the `db/seeds.rb` file, write a script that will create 9 people.
- Each person should have a unique name
- Use each of the 3 methods to create people (experiment with different syntaxes)
- Test your file by running `rake db:seed`

Alter the index page:

- order by first name
- filter so only awesome people are shown
- filter so only people with green eyes are shown
