# Hash Practice

Take the array of hashes named @people on the people/index page and display them in a table.
-the data is random so don't be surprised when it changes on refresh.
- an example hash of a person:
{
  :first_name=>"Julia", :last_name=>"White",
 :date_of_birth=>Sun, 29 Jan 1995, :eye_color=>"hazel",
 :telephone_number=>"547-161-2114",
 :dog => {name: => "Joe", breed: => "golden", age: => 15}

 }

- you only have to use the people/index.html.erb page to complete this!
- each person has a dog, which is it's own hash.
